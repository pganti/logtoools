logtools (0.12) unstable; urgency=LOW

  * clfmerge -d now converts domain names to lower case.

  * clfdomainsplit now converts all domain names to lower case internally
    (for sorting and matching purposes), it still exposes upper-case domains
    on its output.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Wed, 11 Jul 2001 17:09:00 +0200

logtools (0.11) unstable; urgency=LOW

    characters.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Tue, 12 Jun 2001 11:58:49 +0200

logtools (0.10) unstable; urgency=MEDIUM

  * Made clfdomainsplit handle IP addresses and send them to the default file
    (first code to actually use the default file).

  * Fixed clfmerge so that the -d option will not mess with a URL that is
    already fully qualified (checks for "http://" at the start).

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Thu, 7 Jun 2001 23:49:55 +0200

logtools (0.08) unstable; urgency=MEDIUM

  * Made clfdomainsplit easier to hack (the base code could be used for
    splitting any text file if 3 small functions are changed).

  * Make clfdomainsplit use multiple processes to solve file handle limits,
    this code isn't yet tested...

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Mon, 8 May 2001 13:50:29 +0200

logtools (0.07) unstable; urgency=MEDIUM

  * Updated the description with more content and fixed some formatting issues.
    Closes: #78976

  * Made it clean the config.cache file (and other config data) before
    packaging the source.
    Closes: #96290

  * Fixed a bug where clfmerge would output the last line twice if there was
    only a single log file and buffering was on.

  * Now "domain name mangling" actually works for clfmerge!

  * Added new clfdomainsplit program.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Mon, 7 May 2001 13:52:41 +0200

logtools (0.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add option to change buffer size for clfmerge.

  * Also added an option for "domain name mangling" to clfmerge.  This means
    that the web logs are expected to have a domain name preceeding the regular
    CLF format (as suggested in the Apache documentation for mass virtual
    hosting).
    See http://www.apache.org/DELETE_ME/vhosts/mass.html .

  * Fixed a bunch of errors in the man pages.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Wed, 2 May 2001 18:11:24 +0200

logtools (0.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
